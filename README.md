## APerf

A CLI tool to gather many pieces of performance data in one go.

## Requirements
* Rust toolchain (v1.61.0+) - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* Node.js (v16.16.0+) - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Building from source
```
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run
```

## Usage
```
./aperf-collector -h
./aperf-visualizer -h
```

## Example
```
./aperf-collector -i 1 -p 10
```
* This collects the performance data in 1 second time intervals for 10 seconds.
```
./aperf-visualizer --run-directory <directory>
```
* This will visualize all the data in <directory>.
* <directory> is generated by running aperf-collector.
```
./aperf-visualizer --run-directory <directory1> --run-directory <directory2>
```
* This will visualize the data in both the directories side-by-side.

## Logs
* env_logger is used to log information about the tool run to stdout.
* To see it, use `export APERF_LOG_LEVEL=info`.
* To see more detail, use `export APERF_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
